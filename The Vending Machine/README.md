# This is an assignment I had in CS 3354 Object Oriented Programming.
This program is a mock vending machine in which a user can add coins to pay for a vending machine item.<br>
The machine also has an administrator option which contains a login option and the user can then restock the machine and collect the money that the machine has made.
